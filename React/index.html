        <h1>Installing React</h1>
        <p>Open terminal and type <code>npm install create-react-app -g</code> This step has to be done only once to have React on our computer globally for each new project we create</p>
        <p>The next step is to create project. Run the command <code>create-react-app some-project-name</code> Once created navigate to that folder and there run the command <code>npm start</code></p>

        <h1>The very basic example</h1>
        <p>We would do some change in the App.js file and see the result. Note that for css class we dont use the class word but className instead because class is reserved key word in JS.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT to keep in mind is that in the return statement has to return everything wrapped up in one html element. We cant return 2 or more html elements on the main level. Also the round brackets are important so we can write multiline expressions.</p>
        <img src="./images/image1.PNG" alt="the initial">
        <p>And in the browser we will see the following result</p>

        <h1>Creating simple functional component</h1>
        <p>Below is our custom functional component. And also you can see how we can write some valid javascript in the template</p>
        <img src="./images/image10.PNG" alt="functional component">
        <p>And we will import and use our custom Person component in the App component</p>
        <img src="./images/image11.PNG" alt="functional component">
        <p>And in the browser we get this result</p>

        <h1>Providing props</h1>
        <p>In the parent component where we place the child component we can provide properties which we can get and use in the child component</p>
        <p>Also note the content between the component tags, we can also get it and use it in the component.</p>
        <img src="./images/image20.PNG" alt="providing props">
        <p>In the component we use the keyword props to get and properties we provided.</p>
        <p>children is also key word with which we get the content between the component tags</p>
        <img src="./images/image21.PNG" alt="providing props">
        <p>And this will be the result.</p>

        <h1>State of the class</h1>
        <p>To have more dynamic components we can have state, which holds some data the class will use. And for example we can provide some data from the state to child components more dynamically.</p>
        <p>And on click we will change the state with the setState method.</p>

        <h1>State hook</h1>
        <p>State hook is giving us the ability to have state in functional components instead of class components. useState method can be called multiple times so it is best practice to use each type of state(like object, array, number, string etc.) in different useState because calling set state all other properties will be deleted.</p>
        <img src="./images/image40.PNG" alt="function state">
        <p>On the screenshot you can see we changed the object but we still keep the string "awesome" because it is placed in his own useState method.</p>

        <h1>Method reference</h1>
        <p>Sometimes we want the child component to call methods from the parent component. We can do that by providing method reference to the child component. What we do here is we provide the method as props</p>
        <img src="./images/image50.PNG" alt="method reference">
        <p>And in the child component we set the props with method reference in this example to click event</p>
        <img src="./images/image51.PNG" alt="method reference">
        <p>Below is the same code as above but in this example we provide value as parameter.</p>
        <img src="./images/image52.PNG" alt="method reference">
        <p>And once we click on the paragraph we see the updated value</p>

        <img src="./images/image70.PNG" alt="two-way data binding">
        <p>This is the child component</p>
        <img src="./images/image71.PNG" alt="two-way data binding">
        <p>And we see when we type it is immediately updated</p>

        <h1>Inline styles</h1>
        <p>Sometimes we would want to set some styles inline we can do it in the following way. First we create an object holding all the styles we want to use and then assign that object to the style attribute of the html element.</p>
        <img src="./images/image80.PNG" alt="inline style">
        <p>And we get the following result in the browser</p>

        <h1>HTTP GET Request</h1>
        <p>To make HTTP requests we will use librabry called axios. We need to install it by typing in the terminal <code>npm install axios --save</code>.</p>
        <p>Then we make the request in componentDidMount lifecycle hook.</p>
